					<b>EEG-based Emotion Recognition in Music:</b> A research project I
					conducted in high school alongside a professor at a local university,
					where I wrote Python code to train a SVM-based machine learning model
					to predict someone's emotional response to music. I also created a
					demonstration application where an EEG headset could be connected, and
					it would predict the emotional response of the wearer.

					<b>SSMIF Fall 2022 Coding Challenge:</b> In Fall 2022, I applied to
					the Stevens Student Managed Investment Fund (SSMIF). As the second
					round of the application, we had to solve a Python coding challenge.
					The first question I solved had me calculate various metrics (ex:
					Volatility, Sharpe Ratio) and do statistical tests on Coke and Tesla's
					stocks based on 2021 data, and for the second challenge I did a
					stepwise linear regression, as well as a Bayesian Ridge regression on
					polynomial transformed features for a given dataset.
