					<li>
						EEG-based Emotion Recognition in Music: A research project I
						conducted in high school alongside a professor at a local
						university, where I wrote Python code to train a SVM-based machine
						learning model to predict someone's emotional response to music.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						SSMIF Fall 2022 Coding Challenge: In Fall 2022, I applied to the
						Stevens Student Managed Investment Fund (SSMIF). As the second round
						of the application, we had to solve a Python coding challenge. The
						first question I solved had me calculate various metrics (ex:
						Volatility, Sharpe Ratio) and do statistical tests on Coke and
						Tesla's stocks based on 2021 data, and for the second challenge I
						did a stepwise linear regression, as well as a BayesianRidge
						regression on polynomial transformed features for a given dataset.
					</li>

					<li>
						My New Tab: A website I created that I use as my browser's new tab
						page using simple HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can take a look at
						it

					<li>
						RedditScraping: A small Python program with a GUI I made to use
						Reddit's API to collect memes that matched a given search, and
						display those memes in a viewer.
